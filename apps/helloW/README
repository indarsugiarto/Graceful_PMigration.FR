This simple hello world application will print "hello world" every second.
The trigger program will move the hello world program from one core to another core.

Here how it is supposed to work:
1. Load supv in core-17
2. Load helloW in core-1
3. Load trigger in core-2
   - it will ask supv to move helloW from core-1 to core3
